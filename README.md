#Robustness update

@lxterminal was added to
~/.config/lxsession/LXDE-pi/autostart
to create a terminal at startup

superscript was created and reads:
/var/www/html/UpdateFromGit.sh
/var/www/html/keepchromiumopen.sh

The line ./superscript
was added to .bashrc
 
on login the pi now, updates from git and opens chromium (reopens if it crashes)
